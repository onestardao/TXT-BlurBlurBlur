> 🔐 Lite / 🔐 Pro 

Blur Blur Blur is a **TXT-driven image generation interface**, built to stabilize AI visuals through semantic density, ΔS = 0.5 balance, and poetic compression.

Unlike traditional prompt injection, Blur simulates visual cognition:  
- 📐 Logic compression  
- 🧬 Visual metaphor fusion  
- 🌌 Philosophical scene design

All powered through plain text.  
All interoperable with the WFGY semantic engine.
